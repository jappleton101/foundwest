The hierarchy of needs is a subject that’s covered in standard undergraduate psychology courses. It’s an assertion by Abraham Maslow that in order to function optimally, certain needs must be met. However, it’s a hierarchy in the sense that if the ones at the base aren’t being met, we won’t be able to achieve the next levels. I was talking to my friend a few weeks ago about how this applies to our work lives so I wanted to write some thoughts.

For the sake of this post, my starting point for the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is at the (privileged) assumption that food, warmth, rest, safety, and security are covered — I’m talking about the typical corporate job. Helping people who can’t achieve the first two levels is something that can’t be addressed in a single blog post. 

That puts us at belongingness. So many companies stress the culture fit throughout the interview process and then assume that a team will build chemistry by working next to each other in cubicles. People are brought closer through shared experience — wearing the same color shirt and then making some joke about how, “I didn’t get the memo” doesn’t count as a shared experience. A team should get out there and do something that’s not just a happy hour where people end up getting drunk and talking about work. Make it goal focused. My personal favorites are team workouts and Habitat for Humanity build days.

Prestige/accomplishment is more abstract depending on the job function. Accomplishment for an engineer is building a good product and that’s all I’ve ever been so I can’t speak much to other disciplines. But I know that when you have seniority over someone, your feedback carries weight in their mind so praising their efforts goes a long way — as long as it’s sincere. If the person is falling short, give an honest, constructive critique without making them question their job security (remember, that’s the base of the pyramid so it will set off alarm bells if it gets shaken). Ideally, if you’re able to help them grow and develop, there will be a point at which you can honestly praise them, and their future managers will do the same. 

Self actualization gets tricky and for most, I don’t think it will be achieved at a 9-5 job. But there’s nothing wrong with that! Writing has always been my creative outlet but I never wanted to do it for a living. When I’m part of a good team at work and producing something that people find useful, I’m grateful to have the freedom to pursue writing in my spare time. Also, if I had to write everyday to pay the bills, I might end up hating it! 

Adam Grant explores this concept more deeply and calls it a risk portfolio in his latest book Originals. By pursuing a career that gives us a stable way to provide for ourselves, we’re free to take risks with something not tied to our livelihood. Here's a quote from Originals:

“Brian May was in the middle of doctoral studies in astrophysics when he started playing guitar in a new band, but he didn’t drop out until several years later to go all in with Queen.”

For those of us who can achieve self actualization at work, it will be if the mission of your company directly aligns with your core values as an individual. My brother is a doctor who values healthy living and self care above most other things. Since he started his residency, he’s been at the top of his pyramid. When I’m building things during the day, and sharing knowledge at night, I feel like I’m standing right there next to him.
