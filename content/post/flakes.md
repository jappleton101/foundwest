Technology has an interesting impact on how we plan our social lives. For formal things, it used to be letters and invitations. Now those are pretty much reserved for weddings and pretentious charity events. If you wanted to make plans on the fly, it was just the people in your immediate vicinity. Neighborhood friends are no longer a staple of suburban life. Texts, Facebook events, and dating apps dominate how we plan our socials. Taps, swipes, and buzzing phones have replaced chats while picking up the newspaper or during a chance encounter at the grocery store. 

I'm not a dinosaur. I'm writing this on my laptop while my cell phone sits next to me and Facebook is open in another tab. I've gone on Tinder dates. Quick and direct communication is a good thing. It's easier to expand our social circles and coordinate larger groups with technology. We have more ways to maintain close relationships. I don't want to handwrite a bunch of invitations if I decide to have a barbecue.

We don't need to hear the disappointment in their voices when you call to cancel or see the look of frustration when you don't show up. Send a text and you haven't violated social etiquette. And if you know you'll never see them again, you don't even have to do that! You can just ghost them.

I come talk to you at a bar and you're not interested, turn away and end the conversation. My business plan doesn't make sense? Tell me that I need to refine it. 

The coarseness of New Yorkers is grating to Californians and part of me appreciates that everyone is considerate, but saving feelings can
