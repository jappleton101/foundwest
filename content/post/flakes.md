Technology has an interesting impact on how we plan our social lives. For formal things, it used to be letters and invitations. Now those are pretty much reserved for weddings and pretentious charity events. If you wanted to make plans on the fly, it was just the people in your immediate vicinity. Neighborhood friends are no longer a staple of suburban life. Texts, Facebook events, and dating apps dominate how we plan our social lives. Taps, swipes, and buzzing phones have replaced chats while picking up the newspaper or check-ins during an encounter at the grocery store. 

I'm not a dinosaur. I'm writing this on my laptop while my cell phone sits next to me and Facebook is open in another tab. I've gone on Tinder dates. Quick and direct communication is a good thing. It's easier to expand our social circles and coordinate larger groups with technology. We have more ways to maintain close relationships. I definitely don't want to handwrite a bunch of invitations if I decide to have a barbecue. 

But all this technology allows us to hide. Canceling plans with a friend is just like clearning a notification. We don't need to hear the disappointment in their voices when you call to cancel or see their look of frustration when you don't show up. You're not violating social etiquette as long as you send a text. And if you know you'll never see them again, you don't even have to do that! You can just ghost them. 

The Bay Area is full of people who embrace technology and that's why I came here. But technology doesn't excuse bad manners. The number one rule in New York City is, "don't waste my time". I come talk to you at a bar and you're not interested, turn away and end the conversation. My business plan doesn't make sense? Tell me that I need to refine it. 

The directness of New Yorkers often comes without diplomacy. I remember how regulary I would hear, "Get out of the way asshole!" if someone was blocking the sidewalk. If you're not used to it, it's jarring. But eventually you realize it's nothing personal and in a city where everyone is trying to get things done, there's value in getting to the point. 

So, Bay Area natives, I don't expect you become full-on New Yorkers, but being candid goes a long way. I think some of the not-so-direct behavior here is the result of good intentions -- you don't want to disappoint someone or hurt their feelings, so you don't tell them exactly how you're feeling -- but sometimes tough love is equally important. It offers people the chance to learn and it strengthens your character. When someone questions your actions, it forces you to decide whether or not you acted in a way consistent with your identity, and then justify it. 

As for the flakiness, commit once in a while! If someone asks you to do something, do it (or don't do it) because that's what YOU decided. Don't do it because it's just something to do, knowing full well that you'll cancel if something better pops up. But in a city that was built by people looking for the next big thing, that may be asking too much.
