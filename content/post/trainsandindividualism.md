"Attention passengers, there's been a collision with a trespasser near the Redwood City station and our train needs to hold at Palo Alto. We don't know when we'll be able to move past that station."

The whole train car groaned and a lot of us left before the doors could close. I went to a local bar with some coworkers and learned that, "collision with a trespasser" was the polite way of saying someone committed suicide by stepping in front of a train. 

My inner east coaster slipped out and the first thing I said was, "that's so selfish". The assessment was met with some tense laughter but ultimately, we agreed that it's a selfish way to take your own life. You're escaping personal problems in a way that affects thousands of people who have no stake in what's going on. [Japanese train companies actually penalize your family if you commit suicide by stepping in front of a train](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/06/world/kunitachi-city-journal-japanese-trains-try-to-shed-a-gruesome-appeal.html). None of this is meant to undermine suicide – if you're depressed and need help, call someone – but I couldn’t help but think about the other ways where individualism can get on my nerves.  

On the individualism/collectivism spectrum, Japan and America are pretty much opposite end points. Obviously, there are less extreme examples of individualism taken too far than suicide by train — anything from talking loudly on your phone in quiet, crowded place to driving too slow in the left lane for miles. But in many cases, personal choices can unnecessarily annoy and inconvenience others. My favorite (least favorite?) example is when traffic is backed up at an exit ramp, then there’s that person who cuts the whole line and veers over at the last second. If he can’t fit all the way in, another lane is blocked and even when he eventually does get in (because he always does), the people behind are punished for having good etiquette. 

I don't expect Americans to suddenly become Japanese, but I think there's a middle ground where we can be tactfully individualistic through increased social awareness. Learning to assess the situation and surroundings is an easy first step. 

"Do I need to make this phone call right now?"

"A lot of cars are passing me on the right, I should probably move over."

On a scale of "California surfer bro" to "New York City banker", my reaction to the train incident was  somewhere in between. A friend witnessed the same thing on NJ transit and the first thing someone said after the conductor's announcement was, "what a fucking asshole". Profane, insensitive but ultimately accurate — New Jersey through and through. I've been in California for 2 years but I'm glad I developed a bit more compassion and managed to keep my honesty.
