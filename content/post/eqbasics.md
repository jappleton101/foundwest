Engineers live in worlds defined by physical rules and logical outcomes. Write this line of code here, and that happens over there. As more and more lines get strung together, it becomes harder to gauge the overall effect of the instructions, but there’s always a trail of bytes to follow. Good engineers are so valuable because of their deep domain expertise, but a common criticism is that they lack certain social graces, or that they’re notoriously difficult to communicate with.

Tinkering and learning new technologies have always been fun for me. But unlike other engineers that I surrounded myself with at school and work, I also enjoy writing and talking to people. Lately I’ve been using this website as an outlet to dump some of my thoughts. In addition to sharing my observations about the world, I want to help engineers reflect on some of their non-technical skills and ideally help improve them.  

One of my favorite things about engineers is their passion for the way things work. It’s impressive to see an experienced programmer instantly know the way to tackle a problem, or how a certain change will impact the system at large. To be a better communicator, you need to know how your own brain works. Think of your ability to communicate as an API — if you want to share your skills with your team or company, you want a well-designed API.

There’s entire fields of study dedicated to understanding the human brain — I certainly don’t claim to be an expert in any of them — but emotional intelligence is a great place to start. It’s like the RESTful API of human interaction. The closest thing to a user’s manual is [Emotional Intelligence 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-2-0-Travis-Bradberry/dp/0974320625/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1478137437&sr=8-1&keywords=emotional+intelligence+2.0). It’s a quick read that will help you familiarize yourself with the 4 dimensions of EQ: self awareness, self management, social awareness, and relationship management. 

Everyone has different emotional triggers and expressions, so recognizing them is much different from how you identify good code. The learning style will be tough and might cause some discomfort, but if you’ve ever heard that you’re not a great team player, it’s worth investing time in developing these skills.

Note: While I generally subscribe to the fact that improving your emotional intelligence is beneficial, it’s worth noting that some of the hype is a little bit overblown. See [here](http://scienceforwork.com/blog/emotional-intelligence-performance/).
