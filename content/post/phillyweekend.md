The city of brotherly love was my home for three years. It’s an accessible place with tons of good places to eat and drink without the crowds and costs of Manhattan. There’s history, art, and beautiful outdoor spaces that can be enjoyed practically year-round (after all, it’s always sunny in Philadelphia). If you want to spent a weekend there, here’s what I recommend.

Coming in Friday night, [Double Knot](http://www.doubleknotphilly.com/) is a great place to start. It’s Asian fusion food in a space that feels like it could be a secret meeting point in a James Bond movie. Small plates make it great for sampling different options and sharing. There’s also a chef’s tasting menu if you’d rather let someone else do the driving. If you’re looking for a nightcap after dinner, there’s a rooftop bar at the Logan Hotel called [Assembly](http://assemblyrooftop.com/). It has some great views of the art museum and Logan Square.

I generally want coffee before I’m ready to do anything else, so my first stop Saturday morning would be [La Colombe](https://www.lacolombe.com/pages/cafes). They have a few cafes throughout the city that and any one is a good option. For breakfast, [Honey’s Sit ’n’ Eat](http://honeyssitneat.com/) has all the staples. You can head straight there if coffee is not a priority. There can be a wait so plan accordingly.

Depending on the weather, you can have a great day either indoors or outdoors. The [Barnes Foundation](http://www.barnesfoundation.org/), the [Philadelphia Museum of Art](http://www.philamuseum.org/), and [the Rodin Museum](http://www.rodinmuseum.org/) are all beautiful indoor options. My personal favorite is the Barnes Foundation. It’s a collection that a doctor amassed throughout his life and it used to be on display in his home, but has since been relocated to a new space in center city. The Art Museum has the Rocky steps if you’re looking to pose by his statue or get in a workout. [The Mutter Museum of Medical Oddities](http://muttermuseum.org/) is interesting, and a little creepy, if you’re looking for something more science-y.

If you want to spend some time outside, I recommend walking or biking down Kelly Drive. The path goes all the way out to Valley Forge and it has great views of the Schuylkill (SKOO-kul) River. [Primo Hoagies](https://www.primohoagies.com/primo-menu.php) is a personal favorite, but if you absolutely need a cheesesteak, [Jim’s Steaks](http://www.jimssteaks.com/) on South Street is the place to go. Also, there’s [Hip City Veg](http://hipcityveg.com/) if you’d rather avoid meat (I don’t know why but I’m trying to be inclusive). 

The most low-key night can be found at the Ranstead Room, [Tria](https://www.triaphilly.com/tria-cafe/), or [Monk’s Café](http://monkscafe.com/). They’re all unique spaces that are great for casual conversation and cocktails, wine, or beer, respectively. Ranstead Room is my personal favorite. It’s one of Philadelphia’s speakeasies and the door is very unassuming. The easiest way to find it is when there’s a line if you don’t know where it is. If you’re looking for something a little more upbeat, [Frankford Hall](http://frankfordhall.com/) has a great outdoor space, Jenga, and a generally more boisterous crowd. If you need to dance and listen to music, then L’Etage is an old favorite. It has a solid bar and an active dance floor that doesn’t feel too much like a club. But if you really wanted a club, you could go to Whisper or Rumor. 

Optional late night pizza stop: Lorenzo’s. Big, thin-crust slices: the way pizza is supposed to be.

If you need some coffee to cure your hangover, then [Elixir](http://www.elixrcoffee.com/) is my other favorite shop. [Miles Table](http://milestable.com/) is another great brunch place on South Street. It’s more casual and if you’re looking for something that’s more lunch-y than eggs, I highly recommend the falafel burger.

Before you leave the city, it’s worth seeing the Liberty Bell if you’re into history, or Reading Terminal Market if you’re still hungry despite all the previously mentioned recommendations.
