Confrontation is another social concept that got lost somewhere in the Midwest. I guess after spending all the effort to cross the Tetons, people just decided that talking shit behind your back was easier than telling you that they don't like . I rarely see people openly disagree here and as soon as things even get mildly heated, you can be sure someone will drop a "bro, chill" before things escalate too far. 

I'll use an analogy to help describe the value of confrontation to Californians – earthquakes. An earthquake happens because the tectonic plates are sliding under each other and one is slowly bending and building pressure. Eventually, the pressure gets to be too much and the bending plate springs back up, shaking until it reaches equilibrium. All the research warns us about "the big one", which is an earthquake scientists think will happen because the plates are getting too far wedged into one another without a release.

Well, people are a lot like plates. When we interact, there are little things we do that can create pressure and tension between us. It's not necessarily intentional or malicious, but it happens. The longer the pressure builds, the more stress each party endures and the more intense the earthquake will be. Ok, so maybe it's not the perfect analogy, but hopefully you get the point. Telling someone that what they're doing bothers you can be productive for both parties -- assuming it's something he or she can change. The negativity surrounding confrontation comes from when unchecked anger dominates the interaction, and that usually happens when you wait too long to address something. Or when you have no tact.

The most successful use of confrontation that I've ever had was when I was leading a cross country bike trip. It was a supported ride so we had a van and trailer that was going ahead of the riders. We were in the Midwest so there were a lot of farm roads that weren't  well-maintained and we could only rely on google maps to select the route. It had just rained heavily so the van and trailer got stuck in some mud when I rode up on my bike. 

The leader who was driving felt bad but we were a team and we were going to figure it out. She called triple-A and a tow truck arrived. As soon as the driver opened his mouth, I didn't like him. He was telling us how it was going to cost $500 for him to get his bigger tow truck because we had the trailer and her coverage was only for a vehicle. 

At the time, we weren't super clear on how the triple-A worked but the guy kept butting in while we tried to reason through our options. It became clear he was trying to bully is into a decision that was good for him. The next time he started talking, I loudly but calmly interrupted him and said, "Excuse me but this decision doesn't involve you. My team is going to decide what's best for us and we'll let you know if we need your help."

His tone immediately changed and he actually started negotiating with us because he knew we weren't getting railroaded into the choice that was clearly better for him. Ultimately, Triple-A covered our van and a friendly neighbor came through with his pickup truck to get the trailer out of the mud. We unhitched the trailer, the neighbor grabbed it, and the tow truck grabbed the van. 

Confrontation is a great counter to when someone tries making a strong aggressive play.  It doesn’t have to be rude and for trivial things — I think that’s the stereotypical New Yorker behavior — but when used in the right situations, it can be a critical part of your social toolkit.
