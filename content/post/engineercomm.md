There's an old joke that programmers are people who turn coffee into code. 

If you look at a software developer – but really, any profession – you're using your the processing power of your brain to do something useful for other people. The actual neurons get slower as we age, but most people become more effective at their job as they age. A common way to describe this is Talent + Effort = Skill. Talents are the things you're naturally good at, and effort is the time you spend developing certain skills that are (ideally) related to your talents. 

My observation with STEM folks is that they get laser focused on technical Effort – things like learning new frameworks or programming languages. Developing your technical ability is like increasing the raw computing power of a computer – always appreciated, but not the only consideration when making a selection. To continue the analogy, things like your communication/organizational skills are similar to a product's documentation. 

Do you want to use a product that offers a 10% increase in speed but the only documentation is scribbled on the back of a Doritos bag? 

I know I wouldn't. 

Communication is a skill that can be developed just like proficiency in building modern web applications but you need to know where and how to put in effort. Growing in this area can be espcially hard because it often requires breaking emotional habits that you've reinforced over the years so don't get discouraged if it takes you some time to grow. There are plenty of books that can go deeply into teaching you how to develop better communication skills, but I consistently see the same things in my encounters with great communicators. 

First and foremost, they're able to step outside the world of facts, logic, and math that characterizes engineering. Reading literature can be helpful in understanding the social implications of an interaction. I stand by the fact that Pride & Prejudice drastically improved my communication skills. Good literature helps you understand how people's words tell you about their inner world.

They're aware of people's feelings and intentions – clearly exchanging facts is an important part of communicating, but so is understanding how a those facts make you or someone else feel feel. Reading about emotional intelligence, body language, and social psychology can be helpful if you feel lost in these types of situations. Mindfulness helps a lot here, too.

They understand and pay attention to the context of an interaction. Lots of time is wasted in meetings because people don't consider this. Know the expectations of the people who are going to be there. What are you trying to get out of it? What information do they need? What should you prepare ahead of time?

They have high confidence and deep self knowledge.  These two go hand-in-hand because in order to be confident, you need to know what you're capable of doing. This allows you to clearly communicate your limits so that you and your team can work effectively. A rook will never move diagonally on the chess board and it should never have to. 

Books and blog posts can point you in the right direction, but the most important thing is to put yourself in social situations where you can practice navigating these types of interactions. So stop reading, get out there, and talk to someone!
