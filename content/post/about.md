I'm a die-hard east coaster but two years ago, I didn't know that. I grew up in New Jersey - in the suburbs of New York City. My high school was filled with achievers racing to complete one ego-inflating action item after the next: get good grades, go to a good college, and get a job at a top company. I was jaded before I finished high school. Then I lived in Philadelphia for three years after finishing college. It wasn't as cutthroat as New York City, but it still had that edge I now associate with the east coast.

Like plenty of other 25-year olds, I had a quarter-life crisis. After a few visits to dip my toes in the west-coast lifestyle, I decided to take the plunge and show up in San Francisco without a job following a cross-country bicycling trip. You can read more about that [here](https://p2s2014.wordpress.com/). I can use hindsight to craft a narrative about why I moved here, but ultimately I don't think I really knew. I have an engineering degree and I figured San Francisco was a good place to be with one of those so I took that and ran with it. 

Now, after two years of living in San Francisco, I think I have a good handle on what makes the two coasts unique. I don't have a goal for writing this beyond trying to organize my own thoughts. So if you're reading this, thanks and welcome.
